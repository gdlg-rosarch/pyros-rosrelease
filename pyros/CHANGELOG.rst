0.0.7 (2015-10-12)
------------------
- 0.0.7. [alexv]
- Adding log to show rostful node process finishing. [alexv]
- Change message content check to accept empty dicts. [Michal
  Staniaszek]
- Fixing corner cases when passing None as message content. invalid and
  should not work. [alexv]
- Fixing tests. and changed api a little. [alexv]
- Removing useless fancy checks to force disabling rocon when set to
  false. updated rapp_watcher not working anymore. [AlexV]
- Rocon_std_msgs changed from PlatformInfo.uri to MasterInfo.rocon_uri.
  [AlexV]
- Send empty dicts instead of none from client. [Michal Staniaszek]
- Service and topic exceptions caught and messages displayed. [Michal
  Staniaszek]
- Fleshed out topic and service info tuples. [Michal Staniaszek]
- Can check for rocon interface, get interactions. [Michal Staniaszek]

  because of rospy.init_node tricks. [alexv]
- Cosmetics. [alexv]
- Improving how to launch rostest test. fixed hanging nosetest. hooking
  up new test to catkin. [alexv]
- Force-delete for services, test for removal crash on expose. [Michal
  Staniaszek]

  Test service nodes added
- Fix crash when reconfigure removes topics, started on unit tests.
  [Michal Staniaszek]
- Fixing removing from dictionary topic_args. [alexv]
- Stopped removal of slashes from front of topics. [Michal Staniaszek]
- Fixed regex and add/remove issues with topics and services. [Michal
  Staniaszek]
- Fixed topic deletion, multiple calls to add. [Michal Staniaszek]

  The interface now tracks how many calls have been made to the add function and
  ensures that topics are not prematurely deleted from the list. Actions also have
  a similar thing going on, but not sure if it works since they are unused.
  Services are unchanged.

  Ensured uniqueness of topics and services being passed into the system using sets.

  Removed unnecessary ws_name code.

  Issue #27.
- Fix *_waiting list usage, service loss no longer permanent. [Michal
  Staniaszek]

  The lists *_waiting now contain topics, services or actions which we are
  expecting, but do not currently exist. Once it comes into existence, we remove
  it from this list.

  When services disconnect, their loss is no longer permanent. This had to do with
  the services being removed and not added to the waiting list.

  Fixes issue #21.
- Full regex, fixed reconfigure crash. [Michal Staniaszek]

  Can now use full regex in topic or service strings to match incoming strings.

  Fixed crash when dynamic reconfigure receives an invalid string
- Strings with no match characters don't add unwanted topics. [Michal
  Staniaszek]

  Regex fixed with beginning and end of line expected, previously would allow a
  match anywhere in the string.

  Issue #17.
- Removed separate lists for match strings. [Michal Staniaszek]
- Remove printing, unnecessary adding to _args arrays. [Michal
  Staniaszek]
- Adding wildcard * for exposing topics or services. [Michal Staniaszek]

  Implementation should be such that other match characters can be easily added if
  necessary.

  Fixes issue #17.
- Added TODO. [alexv]
- Added exception catching for when rocon interface is not available.
  [Michal Staniaszek]
- Added important technical TODO. [alexv]

0.0.3 (2015-07-01)
------------------
- Preparing pypi release. small fix. [AlexV]
- Adding helper services to access Rosful node from a different process.
  Hacky, working around a limitation of rospy ( cannot publish on a
  topic created in a different process for some reason...). Proper
  design would be to call directly the python method ( work with
  services - node_init not needed ) [AlexV]
- Small cleanup. [AlexV]
- Adding context manager for rospy.init_node and rospy.signal_shutdown.
  No ROS signal handlers anymore. Cleanup properly done when program
  interrupted. [AlexV]
- Playing with signal handlers... [AlexV]
- Improved test. but topic interface not symmetric. needs to deeply test
  message conversion. [AlexV]
- Small fixes and first working test to plug on existing topic. [AlexV]
- Adding first copy from rostful. splitting repo in 2. [AlexV]
- Initial commit. [AlexV]
