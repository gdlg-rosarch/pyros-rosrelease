Roadmap
=======

Mid to long-term goals include :

- extract zmp package from `Pyros`_. it is a generic multiprocess framework, and should only be used as a dependency.
- find or implement the `raft`_ algorithm in python, to enable distributed global state between multiple processes safely.
- interface with `ROS 2`_
- identify and implement the dataflow/topic style concept.
